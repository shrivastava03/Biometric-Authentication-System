## 🚀 Features

✅ Capture eye images using a laptop camera  
✅ Authenticate users based on unique biometric patterns  
✅ Support for multiple users  
✅ Save images associated with usernames  
✅ Option to delete user data  
✅ Preserve existing user data unless explicitly deleted

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **OpenCV** – For real-time image capture and processing  
- **NumPy** – For numerical data manipulation  
- **Pandas** – For handling user data  
- **SQLite** – For secure user data storage

## 💡 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shrivastava03/biometric-auth-system.git
cd biometric-auth-system

Register a New User:
Open the app and follow the prompts to capture and store biometric data.

Authenticate a User:
Run the app and follow the prompts to authenticate using stored data.

Delete a User:
Use the delete option in the app to remove user data.

🏆 How It Works
Captures real-time eye images using OpenCV

Preprocesses the images to enhance feature extraction

Uses machine learning models to authenticate users

Saves and manages user data securely using SQLite

Supports multiple user profiles and preserves data until explicitly deleted

🎯 Future Enhancements
Add support for facial recognition in addition to eye authentication

Improve model accuracy using deep learning techniques

Implement real-time threat detection
